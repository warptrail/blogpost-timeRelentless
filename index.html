        <h1>Time is Relentless</h1>

        <p>
         A common problem most people experience everyday is that of time-management and procrastination. The advancement in smart-phones and having the internet constantly at our fingertips has made it feel like there is a never-ceasing torrent of new information and content that must be scrolled through. Most people have experienced picking up their phone to look up a particular piece of information really quick, only to discover they are scrolling through Instagram and half an hour flew by. How do we refrain the gravitational pull of the content streams?

         The next time this phenomenon happens, the best solution is to simply be aware of the time. Put clocks in places you will see them. Watch the seconds relentlessly tick forward, reminding yourself that each one is unique and the previous one is now gone forever. It really forces one to appreciate and utilize time to its maximum potential.

         The Pomodoro timer is the best tool we have at our disposal. Get in the habit of doing focused tasks for set periods of time. It is literally excessive for the brain. Then give yourself small breaks to allow the brain to wonder for a bit. The goal is to set an intention and dedicate all your mental energy to it for that 25 minutes. The more you get in the habit of these focused sessions, the less distractions and time-sucking activities will sneak into your day.
